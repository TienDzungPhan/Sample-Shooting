# Sample-Shooting
A sample shooting Unity game written in C#

I created this application as a programming assignment in college. 

Players control a rocket to left or right while shooting dropping rocks. They get 10 scores for each on-target shot. As the score increases, the rocks drop faster. If any rock drops off the bottom screen without being shot, it's Game Over.
